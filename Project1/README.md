## CS1501 Project 1

## Goal
To gain a better understanding of search algorithms and symbol tables by implementing an autocompletion
engine.

## Background
In order to make typing on a mobile device quick and easy, an autocomplete feature is commonly implemented
to try to guess what word a user wishes to type before they are finished. Such a feature requires extensive
useof search algorithms.

## Specifications
* Your Box folder contains a copy of the English dictionary that you will use for this project, named dictionary.txt
* You must implement a De La Briandais (DLB) trie data structure (as described in lecture) to use in your project.
* When your program is run, it should first create a new DLB trie and add all of the words in dictionary.txt to that 
trie (this will be the dictionary trie).
* Once the dictionary trie is established, you should prompt the user to start typing a word. For this project,you will
be writing only a simple program to demonstrate autocomplete functionality. Due to complexities with gathering single character input in Java,
you should accept a single character at a time, each followed by Enter. After each character, present the user with the list of predictions of
the word that they are trying to type

If the user types a number (1-5), you should consider the user to have selected the corresponding prediction, and restart the process for a new word. 
Consider $ to be a terminator character; if the userenters a $, consider the characters input so far to be the full word as intended (regardless ofsuggestions). 
Finally, if the user enters a ! at any point, your program should exit.

* To generate the list of predictions, your program should not only consult the dictionary trie, but also keeptrack of what words the user has entered in the past.
If the user has previously entered the samesequence of characters as a prefix to a word, you should prioritize the words that most frequently resulted from this sequence 
previously. If the user has never entered the current sequence before, or has entered fewer than 5 words with the current sequence as a prefix (i.e., not enough words to 
complete the list of 5 predictions), your program should suggest words from dictionary.txt that have the currentsequence as a prefix

*You program should propose at most 5 suggestions at a time. If there are fewer than 5 suggestionsavailable from the user’s history and the dictionary trie combined, then
only print out the available suggestions.

* If the current sequence of characters has not been entered by the user before and does not appear indictionary.txt, you should display a message to the user stating that 
no predicions were found,and allow the user to continue entering characters one at a time. Once the user enters a $, you should consider the word to be finished and add it
to the user’s history so that you can predict it in the future.

* Your program should run in a case sensitive manner in order to allow for easier prediction of proper nouns and acronyms.
* The design of the data structure that keeps track of a user’s previously entered words is entirely up to you.You must create a file named approach.txt that both describes
your approach to implementing this symbol table and justifies your decision to take this approach. Note that this file
does not need to be extensive, just a few lines so the TA is aware of what to look for in your code and why you chose this approach.
* The history of the user’s entered words should persist across runs of your program. To enable this, your program should save a representation of this data structure to the
file user_history.txt before exiting.
  * Do not add this file to your Box folder! It should be generated by your program.
 * Each time the user enters a character, you should use Java’s System.nanoTime() to calculate howlong your program takes to find the predictions. You should display this time
 along with the list ofpredictions
 * After the user enters !, your program should output the average time that was required to produce a list of predictions.
 
 # Additional Notes
 * You are free to use any data structures written by you, the textbook authors, or in the Java standard library to implement the user history symbol table. However, if you use code that you do not
 write yourself, you must research the runtime of that particular implementation and discuss that in your approach.txt.
 * Note that if your user history predictions contain a word that is also contained in the dictionary predictions,this word should not be presented as a suggestion to the user twice in the same prompt 
 (e.g., the final listof predictions in the example above).
 * You do not need to implement any sort of autocorrect. You can assume that each character entered by theuser is intentional.
 * You can assume that the user will not try to enter any numerical characters aside from selecting aprediction.
